		</div>	<h2>Curriculum Development</h2>
<p> A major component of my teaching philosophy is making physics courses more accessible to students. I began teaching at the university level as a highschool student, where I was employed by Oakland Community College as a teaching assistant for an university undergraduate level physical science lecture and lab class.

<p>I am constantly learning and seeking out new ways to improve my teaching skills, which led me to  participate in inquiry driven course development through the Institute of Scientist and Engineer Educators Professional Development Program (2018). This training involved a series of workshops to learn how to incorporate pedagogical methods such as active learning and  inquiry based teaching methods into the classroom. As a followup to this training, I worked with a team based out of the University of South Carolina to redesign and deliver a lab lecture. The specific goal of redesigning the lab was to make the topic and techniques of the lecture on identifying exoplanets from observational data and modeling the results more accessible to non-major students.

<p>I understand that not every student has the same level of background or preparation, and that there are a large variety of methods by which students learn (visual, auditory or kinesthetic), and from the beginning I have tailored how I present the material to best suit the needs of the students, with an emphasis on active learning. A large part of my role as a tutor and teaching assistant (at Oakland Community College and Michigan State University) was to make the course material more accessible to those with documented learning difficulties, and I gained a particular empathy for students who struggle. My interactions with these students have fully inspired me to become a better and more creative teacher.


			<h2>Mentoring</h2>		
<p>  Being a research mentor to students is a passion and priority of mine. Since 2018, I have supervised a number of undergraduate students in research projects. These students have made tremendous achievements, received research awards, presented their science results locally and nationally, contributed to publications and been admitted to competitive graduate schools.
