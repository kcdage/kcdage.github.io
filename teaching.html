		</div>	<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<p> A major component of my teaching philosophy is making physics courses more accessible to students. I began teaching at the university level as a highschool student, where I was employed by Oakland Community College as a teaching assistant for an university undergraduate level physical science lecture and lab class.

<p>I participated in inquiry driven course development through the Institute of Scientist and Engineer Educators Professional Development Program in 2018. This training involved a series of workshops to learn how to incorporate pedagogical methods such as active learning and  inquiry based teaching methods into the classroom.The specific goal of redesigning the lab was to make the topic and techniques of the lecture on identifying exoplanets from observational data and modeling the results more accessible to non-major students.

			<h2>Mentoring</h2>		
<p>  Being a research mentor to students is a passion and priority of mine. Since 2018, I have supervised a number of undergraduate students in research projects. These students have made tremendous achievements, received research awards, presented their science results locally and nationally, contributed to publications and been admitted to competitive graduate schools.

<p> I am also an advocate of peer mentoring. During my time at Michigan State University, I helped to form the Stellar Mentorship Program, which connects undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs to peer mentoring. I also ran a series of workshops for soft skills for graduate and undergraduate students, and organized a semesterly X-ray binary discussion group for graduate and undergraduate students doing related research.
