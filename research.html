				<h2>RZ2109</h2>

						<p>RZ2109 is a  black hole candidate located in a globular cluster (GC) near NGC 4472. It is an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX), meaning that its X-ray luminosity greatly exceeds the Eddington limit for a neutron star. We have analyzed new and archival data in both optical and x-ray, going back to the year 2000. Previous work indicates it is likely to be an ultra compact x-ray binary; the presence of the completely forbidden [OIII] transition line in the optical points towards the binary companion being a white dwarf. Long-term optical and X-ray monitoring of this unique object will help shed light on the nature of the source. The combination of the strong [OIII] line and the strongly variable, as well as the X-ray brightness make RZ2109 very different from other known globular cluster X-ray sources. </p> 

						

				<h2>Globular Cluster ULXs</h2>
				<p> Prior to my thesis work, only a handful of globular cluster ULXs had been studied in any detail, but this changed with my 2019 study which compared the X-ray properties of the nine known sources. New studies in 2020 and 2021 have discovered 10 more of these unique sources, which has sparked a population study to understand the kinds of enviroments that are home to these bright X-ray sources.<p>

			


				<h2>SMC X-1</h2>

				<p>My previous study looked for a link between the change in the super-orbital period (thought to be due to a warped, precessing accretion disk) and the change in the pulse period of the high mass X-ray binary SMC X-1. While the data showed a tentative link between these two observational phenomena, the data at the time was not sufficient to prove a correlation in a statistically compelling manner. However, in 2021, I led a sucessful proposal to monitor the source with NICER, and to use this data to thoroughly probe the physics of the accretion disk as the super-orbital period changes.  <p>
